Anagram : a word that is made by arranging the letters of another word in a different order
eg : "listen" is an anagram of "silent" because they are made of the same letters

class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {

        unordered_map<char,int> s1;
        unordered_map<char,int> t1;
        for(char c:s)
            s1[c]++;
        for(char c:t)
            t1[c]++;
        return s1==t1;

    }
};

Time Complexity: O(n + m)
(where n = s1.length(), m = t1.length())
Space Complexity: O(1)
