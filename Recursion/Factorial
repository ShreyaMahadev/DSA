class Solution {
  public:
    int factorial(int n)
    {
        if(n==1 || n==0)    //Base Case
            return 1;
        else 
            return n*factorial(n-1);
    }
};

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n) because of recursive call stack
(each recursive call is stored in the function call stack, and there are n calls before returning and thus there are n recursive calls)
